## A Quick Note
The scale of what this project is attempting to accomplish is one that can only be done collectively. All contributions are highly valued. For submission guidelines on projects, please consult the [submission guidelines](guidelines.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When possible, please edit the file directly and start a pull request instead of raising an issue.

## Conventions
To establish uniformity accross the project, please adhere to these conventions.
- Use the project's official name, not the repository name. Repository names often use lowercase and place dashes in place of spaces. Fallback to **Title Casing** if capitalization is not clear. 
- Platform tags are listed in the following order: ```Desktop OS```, ```Mobile```, ```CLI```, ```SelfHost```, ```Web```, ```Plugin```
- One space to the ```| left and right |``` for row elements
- For projects with multiple repositories (EX: one for IOS, Windows, etc) link the organization. For API star retrieval use their most popular repository.
- The description should be the repo description. If there are multiple repositories, no description, or an inadequate one, fall back to organization or the projects website. **Do not write your own description.**
- We use [Github Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github)

## Guidelines
- Check the archive, the backlog, and duplicates
- Make sure the category is fitting
- The pull request and commit should have concise and descriptive titles
- If a project is in the grey zone for submission guidelines, include why it should be included.
