##

**Our Goal -** There's plenty of awesome lists on GitHub, many focusing on open source specifically. However I've found them including many long-deprecated apps, cluttered with smaller projects on the verge of extinction, or missing a lot of modern open source projects. 

This list aims to serve as a single centralized location for the best of open source, characterized by a solid user base, solid set of contributors, visible long term growth, and overall product quality. 

<details>
  <summary><b>More Information</b></summary><br />
  Definitive-opensource aims to consolidate only the best open source projects. Our guidelines include strict minimum requirements and additional research for vetting. For a project to pass it's likely popular enough to survive far into the future, however we continously monitor projects on the list and remove anything that no longer fits the criteria. 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  It is a fundamental goal for this list to be as neutral as possible and simply present options, not persuade or redact, regardless of the maintainer's opinion. Projects that fit the criteria, which by passing will inherently be used by thousands to millions, are put on the list. This list is "curated" - not relative to opinion but statistics and facts.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  Although the list is called definitive, in this context it doesn't quite mean the implied dictionary definition of finality. This project can only survive and thrive through continuous contributions by the community, as this list is, in itself, open source.

## FAQ
<details>
  <summary><b>How about a JSON file with scripts or a website?</b></summary> <br />
A JSON file with scripts that generate the README(s) would make fundamental changes and reorganization far easier whilst minimizing formatting and grammatical errors. A website would provide much requested features like tag based filtering and even automation.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
However, for the foreseeable future, the list will to be edited directly as a markdown file for one reason: to keep things simple. The current system lets me focus solely on the projects within, not how to present said projects.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The current markdown system could also be considered a stepping stone to guage the community's needs prior to building a more complex system. I will likely migrate to a JSON file as the project scales and when I have time to architect such a system. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
As for the website, the complexities of web development seem unnecessary and an added pain for a task that can suffice, for now, as a markdown file. Depending on the popularity of the project, however, this idea will remain in the back of my mind.
