## FAQ
<details>
  <summary><b>How about a JSON file with scripts or a website?</b></summary> <br />
A JSON file with scripts that generate the README(s) would make fundamental changes and reorganization far easier whilst minimizing formatting and grammatical errors. A website would provide much requested features like tag based filtering and even automation.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
However, for the foreseeable future, the list will to be edited directly as a markdown file for one reason: to keep things simple. The current system lets me focus solely on the projects within, not how to present said projects.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The current markdown system could also be considered a stepping stone to guage the community's needs prior to building a more complex system. I will likely migrate to a JSON file as the project scales and when I have time to architect such a system. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
As for the website, the complexities of web development seem unnecessary and an added pain for a task that can suffice, for now, as a markdown file. Depending on the popularity of the project, however, this idea will remain in the back of my mind.
