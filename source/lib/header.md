**Our Goal -** There's plenty of awesome lists on GitHub, many focusing on open source specifically. However I've found them including many long-deprecated apps, cluttered with smaller projects on the verge of extinction, or missing a lot of modern open source projects. 

This list aims to serve as a single centralized location for the best of open source, characterized by a solid user base, solid set of contributors, visible long term growth, and overall product quality. 

<details>
  <summary><b>More Information</b></summary><br />
  Definitive-opensource aims to consolidate only the best open source projects. Our guidelines include strict minimum requirements and additional research for vetting. For a project to pass it's likely popular enough to survive far into the future, however we continously monitor projects on the list and remove anything that no longer fits the criteria. 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  It is a fundamental goal for this list to be as neutral as possible and simply present options, not persuade or redact, regardless of the maintainer's opinion. Projects that fit the criteria, which by passing will inherently be used by thousands to millions, are put on the list. This list is "curated" - not relative to opinion but statistics and facts.
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  Although the list is called definitive, in this context it doesn't quite mean the implied dictionary definition of finality. This project can only survive and thrive through continuous contributions by the community, as this list is, in itself, open source.
