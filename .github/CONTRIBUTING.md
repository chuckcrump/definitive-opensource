## A Quick Note
The scale of what this project is attempting to accomplish is one that can only be done collectively. All contributions are highly valued. For submission guidelines on projects, please consult the [submission guidelines](guidelines.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When possible, please edit the file directly and start a pull request instead of raising an issue. DO NOT EDIT THE README. Edit applications.json.

## Conventions
To establish uniformity accross the project, please adhere to these conventions.
- Use the project's official name, not the repository name. Repository names often use lowercase and place dashes in place of spaces. Fallback to **Title Casing** if capitalization is not clear. 
- Platform tags are listed in the following order: ```Desktop OS (Order: Windows, MacOS, Linux)```, ```Mobile (Order: Android, IOS)```, ```CLI```, ```SelfHost```, ```Web```, ```Plugin```
- For projects with multiple repositories (EX: one for IOS, Windows, etc) link the repository with the most stars.
- The description should be the repository description. If there are multiple repositories, no description, or an inadequate one, fall back to the organization, their official website, or the repo's README. **Do not write your own description and only use text from official sources of the project.** The ONLY change you can make is replacing ```|``` with ```-``` to prevent interference with GFM tables. 

>[!NOTE]
>These conventions can seem overly complicated. Make sure you skim over them but don't get too caught up  over them. Basically, just follow what's already been done and fallback here when you aren't sure of something. 

## Guidelines
- Check the archive, the backlog, and duplicates
- Make sure the category is fitting
- The pull request and commit should have concise and descriptive titles
- If a project is in the grey zone for submission guidelines, include why it should be included.
- Proposals for new categories or the re-organization of existing categories must be discussed and approved via an issue prior to the pull request
