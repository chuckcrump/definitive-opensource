# Security Policy

The inherent nature of this project has no security vulnerabilities, but this isn't the case for the hundreds of projects we feature here. Raise an issue if a project had/is having a security incident, and it will be labeled with the appropriate tag.

`ðŸŸ¡` - Low impact issues that do not significantly compromise security
* Weak encryption
* Oudated dependencies with low-severity CVEs.
* Minor security concerns raised but not actively exploited


`ðŸŸ ` - Issues that pose a potential risk but not actively exploited
* Outdated dependencies with moderate-severity CVEs


`ðŸ”´` - High impact issues that are being actively exploited, resulting in a significant security breach
* Outdated dependencies with major security risks
* Leaked API keys


`â­•` - Catastrophic issues with widespread impact
